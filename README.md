# PythonProject
Teaching a group of kids the basics of Python, How to make a simple program (still don't know what program), and the basics of using RaspberryPi
right now im in a planning stage, waiting for the budget to come in for the RaspberryPi's. The funny thing is that i don't know a single
thing about python and am self teaching myself the basics as I go for this.
